# Fortinet SNAT Collision count app in Azure
This is the sample code for the blog post write-up [https://alexankers.com/netdevops/graphing-snat-collisions-netdevops-approach/](https://alexankers.com/netdevops/graphing-snat-collisions-netdevops-approach/) and should be read alongside the blog.

I've tried to structure the artefacts under the name of the Azure service or Fortinet offering they relate to, in the following directories:

| Directory | Component |
| --------- | ------------- |
| azure-function-app | Azure Functions |
| azure-storage-blob | Azure Storage (Containers) |
| fortinet-fortigate | Fortinet FortiGate (NVA) |
